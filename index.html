                Did you know the fastest way to grow as a developer isn’t just working on client projects — it’s building for the joy of creating?
            </p>

            <p>
                I’m <strong>Shawn Scamell</strong>, a Software Engineer with a <strong>2:1 BSc in Software Engineering</strong> from
                <strong>The University of Portsmouth</strong>, based in <span class="locality">Essex, UK</span>.
                I specialise in <strong>full-stack web development</strong> — designing clean, responsive interfaces and building robust,
                scalable back-end systems that bring ideas to life from the first line of code to the finished product.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some of my projects are focused on solving real problems, creating smarter applications, and experimenting with new frameworks.
                Others? They’re just for fun — the kind of builds that start with curiosity and end up teaching me something unexpected.
                Either way, every project sharpens my skills and pushes me further as a developer.
            </p>

            <p>
                Alongside web development, I work with <strong>data analytics</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong>,
                giving my applications an extra layer of intelligence and capability. Whether practical or playful, my projects are
                always built with care, clarity, and purpose.
            </p>
